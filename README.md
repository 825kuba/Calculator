# Calculator project

A simple calculator project.

To fix:

-✔DONE strange behaviour with pressing +/- when the result is being displayed

- ✔DONE to not be able to type anything when the result is being displayed

- ✔DONE add keboard events

- can't change operation type like + to - etc

- display keeps changing height when the numbers are too long - playing with max length of numbers and grid vs flex settings of display

- can only display 15 numbers if . is present (16char length limit)

- add locale!
